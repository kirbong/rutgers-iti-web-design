<!-- Part 4: Develop a JavaScript application that will determine the gross pay for each of five employees. The company pays straight time for the first 40 hours worked by each employee and time and a half for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours. You should input the number of hours each employee worked last week and the hourly rate of each employee. Your program should input this information for each employee and should determine and display the employeeâ€™s gross pay. -->
